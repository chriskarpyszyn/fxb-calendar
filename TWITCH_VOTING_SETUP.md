# Twitch Channel Points Voting Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the Twitch Channel Points voting system for your stream ideas calendar.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:

1. **Twitch Developer Account** - Access to [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
2. **Twitch App** - A registered application with Client ID and Client Secret
3. **Channel Point Reward** - A custom reward created in your Twitch dashboard
4. **Vercel Deployment** - Your calendar app deployed to Vercel

## Step 1: Create Channel Point Reward

1. Go to your [Twitch Creator Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/)
2. Navigate to **Viewer Rewards** ‚Üí **Channel Points**
3. Click **Create Custom Reward**
4. Configure the reward:
   - **Name**: `Vote for Stream Idea`
   - **Cost**: `100` points (adjustable)
   - **Require text input**: ‚úÖ **YES**
   - **Prompt**: `Enter the idea number you want to vote for (shown on calendar)`
   - **Skip reward requests queue**: ‚úÖ **YES** (auto-fulfill)
5. Click **Create**
6. **Save the Reward ID** - you'll need this for the next step

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add these variables to your Vercel project settings and local `.env.local` file:

### Required Variables

```bash
# Twitch API Credentials (get from Twitch Developer Console)
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME=your_twitch_username

# Twitch EventSub Configuration
TWITCH_EVENTSUB_SECRET=your_random_secret_string_here
TWITCH_EVENTSUB_CALLBACK_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/twitch-eventsub
TWITCH_REWARD_ID=your_reward_id_from_step_1

# Existing variables (you should already have these)
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url_here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password_here
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

### How to Get Each Variable

- **TWITCH_CLIENT_ID & TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET**: From [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
- **TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME**: Your Twitch username (without @)
- **TWITCH_EVENTSUB_SECRET**: Generate a random string (like a password)
- **TWITCH_EVENTSUB_CALLBACK_URL**: Your Vercel app URL + `/api/twitch-eventsub`
- **TWITCH_REWARD_ID**: From Step 1 above, or see "Verifying Reward ID" section below

### Verifying Your Reward ID with Twitch CLI

If you need to verify or find your reward ID after registration, use the Twitch CLI:

1. **Install Twitch CLI** (if not already installed):
   - Download from [Twitch CLI releases](https://github.com/twitchdev/twitch-cli/releases)
   - Or install using Scoop: `scoop install twitch` (Windows)

2. **Configure Twitch CLI**:
   ```bash
   twitch configure
   ```
   Enter your Client ID and Client Secret when prompted.

3. **Get User OAuth Token** (required for custom rewards API):
   ```bash
   twitch token -u -s 'channel:read:redemptions'
   ```
   This will open a browser for you to authorize. Copy the access token from the output.

4. **List Your Custom Rewards**:
   ```bash
   twitch api get /channel_points/custom_rewards -q "broadcaster_id=YOUR_BROADCASTER_ID"
   ```
   
   Replace `YOUR_BROADCASTER_ID` with your broadcaster ID (or use the one shown when running `register-eventsub.js`).
   
   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "data": [
       {
         "id": "86710f9c-8f83-41d9-ae63-f8e33ee0d2c8",
         "title": "Vote for Stream Idea",
         "cost": 100,
         "is_user_input_required": true,
         ...
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   
   Look for your "Vote for Stream Idea" reward and copy its `id` field.

**Alternative**: If you don't have the CLI set up, you can find the reward ID in your Twitch Creator Dashboard ‚Üí Channel Points ‚Üí Custom Rewards ‚Üí click on your reward ‚Üí the URL will contain the reward ID.

## Step 3: Register EventSub Subscription

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the registration script**:
   ```bash
   node tools/register-eventsub.js
   ```

3. **Expected output**:
   ```
   üéØ Twitch EventSub Registration Script
   =====================================

   üìã Configuration:
      Channel: your_username
      Reward ID: 86710f9c-8f83-41d9-ae63-f8e33ee0d2c8
      Callback URL: https://your-app.vercel.app/api/twitch-eventsub
      EventSub Type: channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add

   üîç Fetching broadcaster ID...
   ‚úì Broadcaster ID: 123456789

   üí° Note: Reward ID verification skipped.
      Use Twitch CLI to verify your reward ID if needed:
      twitch api get /channel_points/custom_rewards -q "broadcaster_id=123456789"

   üîç Checking for existing subscriptions...
      No existing subscriptions found.

   üì° Registering EventSub subscription...
   ‚úÖ EventSub subscription registered successfully!
      Subscription ID: abc123-def456-ghi789
      Status: webhook_callback_verification_pending
      Created: 10/19/2025, 9:35:00 AM

   ‚è≥ Subscription is pending verification.
      Twitch will send a verification request to:
      https://your-app.vercel.app/api/twitch-eventsub

      Next steps:
      1. Ensure your webhook endpoint is deployed and accessible
      2. Wait 1-2 minutes for Twitch to verify
      3. Run: node check-eventsub-subscriptions.js
      4. Status should change from "pending" to "enabled"

   üéâ Setup complete! Your voting system is ready to receive webhooks.
   ```

4. **Verify the subscription**:
   ```bash
   node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js
   ```
   
   This will show the current subscription status and provide specific guidance based on the state.

## Step 4: Verify EventSub is Working

### Option 1: Use Diagnostic Script (Recommended)

Run the channel points subscription checker:

```bash
node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js
```

This will:
- Validate all required environment variables
- Check if subscription exists
- Display subscription status (enabled/pending/failed)
- Provide specific next steps based on current state

### Option 2: Check All Subscriptions

```bash
node check-eventsub-subscriptions.js
```

This shows all EventSub subscriptions, including channel points voting.

### Option 3: Check Twitch Dashboard

1. Go to [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
2. Click on your app
3. Go to **EventSub** tab
4. Look for `channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add` subscription
5. Verify status shows as "Enabled" (not "Pending" or "Failed")

### Understanding Subscription Status

- **Enabled**: ‚úÖ Subscription is active and ready to receive events
- **webhook_callback_verification_pending**: ‚è≥ Twitch is verifying your webhook endpoint (normal for 1-2 minutes after registration)
- **webhook_callback_verification_failed**: ‚ùå Webhook verification failed - check webhook endpoint accessibility
- **notification_failures_exceeded**: ‚ùå Too many failed webhook deliveries - subscription needs to be re-registered
- **authorization_revoked**: ‚ö†Ô∏è OAuth token was revoked - re-register subscription

## Step 5: Test the Voting System

1. **Start a test stream** (or use your regular stream)
2. **Go to your calendar website**
3. **Submit a test idea** (if you haven't already)
4. **Redeem the "Vote for Stream Idea" reward** on Twitch
5. **Enter the idea number** when prompted
6. **Check that the vote count increases** on your calendar

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Subscription Not Registered

**Symptoms**: 
- Running `node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js` shows "No subscription found"
- Votes don't trigger when channel point reward is redeemed

**Solution**:
1. Ensure your app is deployed to Vercel with all environment variables set
2. Run `node tools/register-eventsub.js` to register the subscription
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for verification
4. Run `node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js` again to verify status is "enabled"

### Issue: Subscription Stuck in "Pending" Status

**Symptoms**: 
- Subscription shows as `webhook_callback_verification_pending` for more than 5 minutes

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Webhook endpoint not accessible**:
   - Verify your Vercel app is deployed and the endpoint `/api/twitch-eventsub` is accessible
   - Check Vercel function logs for incoming verification requests
   - Ensure callback URL uses HTTPS (required by Twitch)

2. **Webhook handler not responding correctly**:
   - Check Vercel function logs for the verification challenge
   - Verify the handler responds with just the challenge string (not JSON)
   - Look for `[EventSub Webhook] Handling verification challenge` in logs

3. **Signature verification failing**:
   - Verify `TWITCH_EVENTSUB_SECRET` matches between registration and webhook handler
   - Check Vercel function logs for signature verification errors
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly in Vercel dashboard

**Action**: Wait a few more minutes, then check again. If still pending, check Vercel logs.

### Issue: Subscription Failed Verification

**Symptoms**: 
- Subscription shows as `webhook_callback_verification_failed`

**Solution**:
1. Check Vercel function logs for errors during verification
2. Verify webhook endpoint is accessible and returns proper responses
3. Run `node tools/register-eventsub.js` again (it will automatically delete failed subscriptions and create new ones)

### Issue: "Channel not found" Error

**Symptoms**: Registration script fails with "Channel not found"

**Solution**:
- Check that `TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME` matches your exact Twitch username
- Username is case-sensitive and should not include @
- Verify the username in Twitch Developer Console

### Issue: "Failed to register EventSub" Error

**Symptoms**: Registration script fails with HTTP error

**Solutions**:

1. **403 Forbidden**:
   - Verify your Twitch app has the correct permissions
   - Check that Client ID and Secret are correct
   - Ensure the reward ID belongs to your channel

2. **400 Bad Request**:
   - Check that callback URL is valid and uses HTTPS
   - Verify reward ID format is correct (UUID)
   - Ensure broadcaster ID is correct

3. **409 Conflict**:
   - A subscription with these parameters already exists
   - Run `node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js` to see existing subscriptions
   - Delete duplicates or failed subscriptions, then re-register

### Issue: Votes Not Appearing

**Symptoms**: 
- Channel point redemption works but votes don't appear on calendar
- Webhook appears to be working (subscription is enabled)

**Diagnostic Steps**:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí `/api/twitch-eventsub`
   - Look for `[EventSub Webhook]` log entries
   - Check for errors in vote processing

2. **Verify Redis Connection**:
   - Check Vercel function logs for Redis connection errors
   - Verify `REDIS_URL` is set correctly in Vercel

3. **Check Idea ID Format**:
   - Look for log entries showing "Invalid idea ID format" or "Idea not found"
   - Ensure users are entering the correct idea number format
   - Check that ideas exist in Redis with matching IDs

4. **Verify Webhook is Receiving Events**:
   - Check for `[EventSub Webhook] Processing channel point redemption` in logs
   - Verify the event contains `user_input` with the idea number

**Solution**: Based on logs, identify the specific failure point and fix accordingly.

### Issue: Signature Verification Failed

**Symptoms**: 
- Vercel logs show "Invalid signature" errors
- Webhook requests are rejected with 401 status

**Solutions**:
- Verify `TWITCH_EVENTSUB_SECRET` is identical in both:
  - Environment variables used for registration
  - Vercel environment variables
- Check that the secret hasn't changed since subscription registration
- Re-register subscription if secret was updated: `node tools/register-eventsub.js`

### Diagnostic Commands

**Check subscription status**:
```bash
node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js
```

**Check all EventSub subscriptions**:
```bash
node check-eventsub-subscriptions.js
```

**Re-register subscription** (cleans up failed ones automatically):
```bash
node tools/register-eventsub.js
```

### Production Deployment Checklist

Before testing in production, verify:

- [ ] All environment variables set in Vercel dashboard:
  - `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`
  - `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME`
  - `TWITCH_EVENTSUB_SECRET`
  - `TWITCH_EVENTSUB_CALLBACK_URL`
  - `TWITCH_REWARD_ID`
  - `REDIS_URL`

- [ ] Webhook endpoint is deployed and accessible:
  - Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/twitch-eventsub` (should return 405 Method Not Allowed for GET, which is correct)

- [ ] Subscription is registered:
  - Run `node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js`
  - Status should be "enabled"

- [ ] Test channel point redemption:
  - Redeem the voting reward on Twitch
  - Check Vercel logs for webhook receipt
  - Verify vote appears on calendar

### Getting Help

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - Go to Functions tab ‚Üí `/api/twitch-eventsub`
   - Look for `[EventSub Webhook]` prefixed log entries
   - These provide detailed diagnostics at each step

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Use `node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js` to validate configuration
   - Ensure all variables are set in Vercel dashboard (Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables)
   - Check that `.env.local` matches your Vercel settings

3. **Test Subscription Status**:
   - Run `node tools/check-channel-points-subscription.js` for detailed status
   - Run `node check-eventsub-subscriptions.js` to see all subscriptions

4. **Re-register if Needed**:
   - The registration script now handles cleanup of failed subscriptions
   - Run `node tools/register-eventsub.js` to fix most subscription issues

## Next Steps

Once everything is working:

1. **Customize the reward** - Adjust point cost, name, or description
2. **Monitor voting activity** - Check your admin dashboard for vote statistics
3. **Set up notifications** - Consider Discord integration for vote alerts
4. **Plan voting periods** - Decide when voting opens/closes for each stream

## Security Notes

- Keep your `TWITCH_EVENTSUB_SECRET` private and secure
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- The webhook endpoint verifies signatures to prevent spoofing
- All vote data is stored securely in Redis
